This feature was the motivation for this application. Every week the app generates a meal plan based on your cooking habits and preferences. The app finds a variety of recipes while trying to reuse as many ingredients as possible especially the ones you already have at home. You can also request or disrequest ingredients to be cointained in the plan. It is also possible to replace recipes if you wish. There are several reasons to planning meals this way: 
* Reducing shopping time: You save time shopping because there are fewer things you have to buy. This is because you will already have many of the ingredients in the plan, and you can purchase other ingredients in larger quantities since they are being used in several recipes. 
* Reducing food wastage: Cooking food with a great variety of ingredients and having a large amount of unused items increases the chances of food spoilage. This plan minimizes this.
* Saving cooking time: Reusing ingredients means there are higher chances of batch cooking. For example, the same may be chopped or marinate in the different recipes. You can do it when you cook the first meal and not have to do it again when cooking the second one on another day.
* Saving money: Besides saving money by reducing waste. You can also cut your grocery spending. You can select ingredients to be used in the plan and their quantities. So you can make better use of discounts in your grocery store.
